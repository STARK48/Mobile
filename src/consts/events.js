        title:'BAOBAB FOSA FESTIVAL',
        description:'This event is organized every year at the end of July in Morondava on the west coast of Madagascar. Organized by the Regional Office of Tourism of Menabe, the ceremony begins with a parade that takes place in the city center of the region. You will see musicians and dancers walking around the city. Non Governmental Organizations and tourism companies come to present and talk about their different organizations. This launch is just a taste of the party. The following days, you can soak up the local culture. Several activities are planned, the most important of which are the discovery of the sumptuous path of the baobabs or the visit of the kirindy forest where the animal lives the "fosa". These are the two elements that gave this name to the festival. For those who do not know, baobabs are the emblem of Madagascar and make Morondava a tourist place par excellence. The fosa, meanwhile, is an endemic predator of Madagascar. It evolves naturally in the Protected Area of MenabeAntimena. A ball is even organized in the evening. You will be able to initiate local dances such as kilalay. Menabe natives through traditional dance performances, music and athletics pay homage to the Sakalava ancestors. The ultimate goal of the baobab fosa festival is to promote Menabe\'s tourism potential and to raise public awareness of the importance of conserving biodiversity.',
